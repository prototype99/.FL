Project Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

A mouse has been one of the most successful user interfaces due to its intuitive
 use

.
 This, paired with the keyboard, has stuck with personal computers as they
 have continuously miniaturised and evolved over time with disproportionately
 little to no changes.
 This interface requires a large, flat, semi-dedicated workspace which creates
 a rigid, fixed layout that consumes a large amount of space.
 The limited set of motions seen in such a setup is well known to cause
 repetitive strain injury.
 The goal of this project is not to solve repetitive strain, however it
 is expected that the final deliverable may assist with such an issue.
 I feel that users could benefit from a compact, portable alternative that
 is similarly low power.

Independent studies suggest that gyroscopic controls are better than the
 traditional computer mouse or a joystick when it comes to aiming, a task
 that is common during personal computing.
 In one such study it is posited that friction could be the reason computer
 mice are less performant than gyroscopic controls, something that makes
 sense when the reason computer mice evolved from ball technology to optical
 technology is considered.

Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) both promise to offer a
 new way to interact with computers in subtly different ways, however a
 high electrical, processing and monetary cost as well as a lack of familiarity
 makes such a notion seem as of yet distant.
 These methods are otherwise compelling due to the fact that they allow
 more natural movement and the ability for the user to feel that they are
 exploring a true three dimensional space.
 It can be expected that VR will become more common as increased demand
 leads to the development of cheaper, more affordable, viable solutions.

Gamepads/controllers could prove to be the perfect stepping stone to future
 VR experiences due to their lower cost.
 Gamepads are designed with ergonomics in mind, allowing a comfortable two
 handed grip for an extended amount of time.
 Due to their prevalence in leisure activities a lot of people already have
 a gamepad, and if not they are often at around the same price as a medium
 quality mouse thus being easily accessible.
 Gamepads are capable of adding new ways to control experiences thanks to
 a variety of features such as variable pressure triggers, joysticks, programmab
le lights and force feedback.

A wide range of gamepads additionally feature gyroscopic and accelerometer
 controls, which could allow for an accurate pointing experience.
 Popular gamepads also have keyboard attachments available on the market,
 which could be considered acceptable if they can at least match the typing
 speed of a standard typist.
 A variety of 'air mouse' devices do exist, however the hardware is often
 a lot less advanced, and they do not feature as large a range of input
 methods, or are as ergonomically designed.

\begin_layout Section
Aim
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Investigate alternatives to mouse and keyboard for a desktop computer by
 prototyping gamepad-based drawing software that could later be extended
 and adapted into a full system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this project there are three main deliverables: the software itself,
 and two pieces of research.
 A large part of the project will follow a linear structure, however near
 the end I plan to adopt an agile/cyclical structure as I perfect the final
 deliverable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create a Linux compatible layer to interact with the gyroscopic controls,
 it is suspected that a library based around libsdl would be the best fit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Successfully translate gyroscopic movements to the movement of an onscreen
 cursor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Research existing art software that utilises the same or similar gamepads
 (if any)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Implement drawing features that illustrate the versatility of the hardware
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Investigate whether it is possible to make it windows compatible to increase
 userbase
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Gather test user feedback
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As part of the project I will test the typing speed of a popular

 attachment/accessory.
 While I feel it is important to have some preliminary data to support justifica
tion for future developments I do not feel it is important as establishing
 whether or not gyroscopic gamepads could be viable as pointing devices
 according to user opinions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The biggest risk I can see is that I have no experience writing software
 to work with gyroscopic gamepads.
 I feel that the allotted time should be enough for me to both design and
 implement the appropriate software to do so.
