A mouse has been one of the most successful user interfaces due to its intuitive
 use
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Yun2015"

\end_inset

.
 This, paired with the keyboard, has stuck with personal computers as they
 have continuously miniaturised and evolved over time with disproportionately
 little to no changes despite the new, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rich options for users to choose from
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 that have emerged.
 This interface 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

requires a surface

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 which is typically flat, and semi-dedicated which creates a rigid, fixed
 workspace layout that consumes a large amount of space compared to the
 other equipment.
 The limited set of motions seen in such a setup is well known to cause
 repetitive strain injury.
 The goal of this project is not to solve repetitive strain, however it
 is expected that the final deliverable may assist with such an issue.
 I feel that users could benefit from a compact, portable alternative that
 is similarly low power.

Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) both promise to offer a
 new way to interact with computers in subtly different ways, however a
 high electrical, processing and monetary cost as well as a lack of familiarity
 makes such a notion seem as of yet distant.
 These methods are otherwise compelling due to the fact that they allow
 more natural movement and the ability for the user to feel that they are
 exploring a true three dimensional space.
 It can be expected that VR will become more common as increased demand
 leads to the development of cheaper, more affordable, viable solutions.

Gamepads/controllers could prove to be the perfect stepping stone to future
 VR experiences due to their lower cost.
 Gamepads are designed with ergonomics in mind, allowing a comfortable two
 handed grip for an extended amount of time.
 Due to their prevalence in leisure activities a lot of people already have
 a gamepad, and if not they are often at around the same price as a medium
 quality mouse thus being easily accessible.
 It is generally accepted that gamepads 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

make couch play better
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nerrel2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, following that logic it has to be wondered what they could do for 'couch
 work'.
 Gamepads are capable of adding new ways to control experiences thanks to
 a variety of features such as variable pressure triggers, joysticks, programmab
le lights and force feedback.
 As an example, on the late steam controller, a user 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

can play Vivaldi on their haptic trackpads
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nerrel2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

; although it may seem comical or absurd at first, this is one example of
 many that illustrates how gamepads can create new experiences using their
 wide variety of inputs, and would be very compelling for a musician especially.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

All the same, trackpads are not a valid alternative to a mouse, as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

even after five years
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 a casual user struggles to use them as effectively as a mouse, a concerning
 fact considering the rising popularity of laptop devices.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Applying any pressure at all will create friction with the pad
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nerrel2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 which may explain why the computer mouse (two low friction surfaces) does
 comparably better than the trackpad (a low friction surface and a high
 friction surface).
 Another highlighted issue is having to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

to make multiple swipes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 an issue that was in fact experienced in the making of this feasibility
 study.
\begin_inset Newline newline

A wide range of gamepads additionally feature gyroscopic and accelerometer
 controls, which could allow for an accurate pointing experience.
 During testing Valve found motion control to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too tiring in some use cases
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nerrel2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, however this may have been due to the poorer build quality that featured
 in the final version of the steam controller and their inexperience in
 motion control, an argument that could be supported by their later use
 of motion control in the Valve index controllers and the general success
 of the Nintendo Wii: an almost purely motion based experience.
 Popular gamepads also have keyboard attachments available on the market,
 which could be considered acceptable if they can at least match the typing
 speed of a standard typist.
 In one such study it is posited that friction could be the reason computer
 mice are less performant than gyroscopic controls, something that makes
 sense when the reason computer mice evolved from ball technology to optical
 technology is considered.

A variety of 'air mouse' devices do exist, however the hardware is often
 a lot less advanced, and they do not feature as large a range of input
 methods, or are as ergonomically designed.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Yun2015"

\end_inset

 say that air mice 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rely on accelerometers and gyroscopes, which significantly limit the accuracy
 and ease of use
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, however it has to be wondered whether that is only due to the one handed
 nature of such devices, which would likely reduce stability.
 Aiming is a task that is common during personal computing.
 The key issue with aiming is that users typically will make one large estimated
 movement and then 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

make small corrections
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nerrel2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, meaning that any input method used has to be able to effectively accomodate
 both to be of any real use.
 A modern high resolution trackball could also be a solution for such aiming
 tasks, however much like the original trackball it requires 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

regular cleaning
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nerrel2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 which could prove inconvenient due to the fact it is usually a time intensive
 process to clean a trackball.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Novel techniques also exist, such as lidar.
 Another approach is where the device 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sends inaudible sound pulses at a few selected frequencies, and uses the
 frequency shifts to estimate the speed and distance traveled
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

, a form of echolocation.
 Another technique involves

the phase of received WiFi signal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 These newer technologies could all offer compelling experiences, however
 it is too early to be certain as the technologies have yet to properly
 enter the consumer space in a sizeable manner.
 In the context of the aforementiened two techniques,

For this project there are three main deliverables: the software itself,
 and two pieces of research.
 A large part of the project will follow a linear structure, however near
 the end I plan to adopt an agile/cyclical structure as I perfect the final
 deliverable

\begin_layout Enumerate
As part of the project I will test the typing speed of a popular

 While I feel it is important to have some preliminary data to support justifica
tion for future developments I do not feel it is important as establishing
 whether or not gyroscopic gamepads could be viable as pointing devices
 according to user opinions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The biggest risk I can see is that I have no experience writing software
 to work with gyroscopic gamepads.
 I feel that the allotted time should be enough for me to both design and
 implement the appropriate software to do so.
