To run the software:
______________________
If using the artifact, you can find it under ./out/artifacts/DOTFL_jar/.FL.jar
the best solution: open the source code using intellij idea and run it, it will automatically open when ready
If using the .jar artifact ideally: go in terminal and use the command:
java -jar [file]
Alternative option for the .jar artifact: double click the .jar ,

Windows usage has not fully been tested, but the software should be universal if it compiled correctly. either way, the system may need to have SDL2 installed.

To use the software
_____________________
Each test will occur once using the mouse then once using the gamepad gyroscope. The software was tested and developed with a dualsense gamepad, there is a possibility that other gamepads do not perform correctly.
Firstly: you will do a test where you have to draw the circle
Secondly: you will do a test where you aim for targets
Thirdly: a base64 encoded string will appear, this can be decoded for the results

Historically I have never been good with deadlines, and once again it would seem I have failed myself. The last code change based on git commits is 17.5.2022, 11:33, make of that what you will. I kept telling myself the separate product submission was a product of malicious imagination, after all, there's a product showcase, why would there be a product submission? All the code is included in the report. It turns out that there very much is one, and I should trust myself less. The git repository was omitted for size reasons, however it can be seen at https://github.com/prototype99/.FL , the last code commit is https://github.com/prototype99/.FL/commit/fb27ac57fc3fc63ab75ac9e20bb77486f4f1619a , this branch of the repository is specifically called the submission branch, to reduce confusion.
